# CS50 – Final Project- Portfolio Analysis by A.I.
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: 
  In my final project, I develop a weak A.I. to recommend a stock to add into user portfolio. This development is built on CS50 problem set – Finance web application which allow to provide basic Functions of Quote, Buy , Sell, Statement. Now, I added additional basic analysis feature to 1) show 3 months stock price graph, 2) the risk level of your portfolio, 3) recommend stock based on risk level. In order to do that, I work in CS50 IDE environment and using Python, SQL and HTML language to develop the A.I. feature.

##### Architecture: Using Flask as the web framework and implement with Model(SQL & CSV) - View(HTML & CSS) - Controller(Python) design pattern with consume IEX Cloud API for data collection
